- Features: 16
- Target Variable: `num` (converted into binary classification)

The dataset contains patient medical attributes such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type (cp)
- Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)
- Cholesterol (chol)
- Maximum Heart Rate (thalach)
- Exercise Induced Angina (exang)
- ST Depression (oldpeak)
- And more...
## 🤖 Model Used
